# Sum of Two Numbers (Java)

This Java program calculates and displays the sum of two integer numbers entered by the user.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input two integers. It then calculates their sum and prints the result to the console.  It also demonstrates the use of a `try-finally` block to ensure the `Scanner` resource is closed properly.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `SumOfTwoNumbers.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    javac SumOfTwoNumbers.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java SumOfTwoNumbers
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter the first number, press Enter, and then enter the second number, and press Enter again.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display the sum of the two numbers.
